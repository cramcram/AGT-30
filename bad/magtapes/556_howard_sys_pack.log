starting preprocessing to determine head skew...

execution-time configuration:
  we set ntrks=7 as implied by the -order string "012345p"
  7 track NRZI encoding, odd parity, 556 BPI at 50 IPS (35.97 usec/bit)
  first sample is at time 4.00000000 seconds on the tape
  sampling rate is 781,250 Hz (1.28 usec), or about 28 samples per bit
  peak detection window width is 19 samples (24.32 usec)
  input data order: 0(msb)12345(lsb)p

head skew compensation after reading the first 1 blocks:
  track 0 delayed by 0 clocks (0.00 usec) based on 998 observed flux transitions
  track 1 delayed by 0 clocks (0.00 usec) based on 804 observed flux transitions
  track 2 delayed by 0 clocks (0.00 usec) based on 930 observed flux transitions
  track 3 delayed by 0 clocks (0.00 usec) based on 845 observed flux transitions
  track 4 delayed by 1 clocks (1.28 usec) based on 746 observed flux transitions
  track 5 delayed by 1 clocks (1.28 usec) based on 1038 observed flux transitions
  track 6 delayed by 1 clocks (1.28 usec) based on 3023 observed flux transitions
  the earliest peak is 33.90 usec, and the latest peak is 35.77 usec
  that peak difference of 1.87 usec, and the largest standard deviation of 1.28 usec, are 5.2% and 3.6% of the nominal bit spacing
  created statistics file "556_howard_sys_pack.peakstats_deskew.csv" from 8,384 measurements of flux transition positions
  to graph it from Excel, open the CSV file, then: insert chart 2D line

556_howard_sys_pack.tap was closed at time 32.08611584 after 518,639 data bytes were extracted from 123 blocks

summary for file "556_howard_sys_pack.tbin":
  21,942,280 samples were processed in 13 seconds (0.106 seconds/block)
  created 1 output file with a total of 519,628 bytes
  decoded 0 tape marks and 123 blocks with 518,639 bytes from 21.38 seconds of tape data
  the last block written was 32.08611584 seconds into the tape
  1 block had errors, 0 had warnings, 0 had mismatched tracks, 0 had bits corrected, 0 had midbit timing errors

  created statistics file "556_howard_sys_pack.peakstats.csv" from 1,070,474 measurements of flux transition positions
  to graph it from Excel, open the CSV file, then: insert chart 2D line
  the earliest peak is 34.71 usec, and the latest peak is 35.92 usec
  that peak difference of 1.21 usec, and the largest standard deviation of 1.68 usec, are 3.4% and 4.7% of the nominal bit spacing
  deskewing with delays up to 5.2% of a bit time wasn't entirely effective
  the tape might have been written by two different drives
  if so you should consider separating the data into those sections
